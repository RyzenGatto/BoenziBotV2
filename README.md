 My dad and I designed and programmed this in 2019 when I was in middle school. Minor updates were made in 2019 when the file was made public. Now, in 2024, this program is outdated and insecure. The Google API has changed as well as Discord's ID structure. May be updated if I get bored. 

The bot is built using Google Sheets integration. The way it functions is it finds the user's discord ID (NOT their tag/username) in a spreadsheet and edits a column on that row.
Note: To enable Google Sheets integration, you need a token.pickel file. Get this file from your Google Sheets API. I did not include it because it has confidential information. You should also not publish your token.pickel file.
